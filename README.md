# Customer-Centric Tableau
This project was built to support customer-focused analytics using Tableau. It includes a compressed CSV data file named `sales_06_FY2020-21.csv.zip`, which contains detailed sales records for the fiscal year 2020â€“21. Additionally, the Tableau workbook `CustomerAnalysis.twb` is provided to help visualize, analyze, and derive actionable insights from the sales data, with a particular emphasis on customer behavior, purchasing trends, and revenue segmentation.
